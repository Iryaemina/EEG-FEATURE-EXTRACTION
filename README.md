# EEG-FEATURE-EXTRACTION
EEG Feature Extraction: Tools for extracting relevant features from EEG signals, including spectral analysis, time-frequency analysis, and statistical measures. These features provide insights into brain activity and can be used for tasks such as seizure detection, sleep stage classification, and cognitive state recognition

This repository provides tools for extracting relevant features from electroencephalography (EEG) signals. These features can be used to gain insights into brain activity and are essential for various EEG-based applications such as seizure detection, sleep analysis, and cognitive state recognition.

## Features

- **Spectral Analysis**: Extract frequency domain features using techniques like Fourier transform, power spectral density, and band power analysis.
- **Frequency Analysis**: Compute frequency-domain features such as dominant frequency, peak frequency, and frequency band power.
- **Time-Frequency Analysis**: Compute time-frequency representations such as spectrograms, wavelet transforms, and short-time Fourier transforms (STFT).
- **Statistical Measures**: Calculate statistical features such as mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis to characterize EEG signals.
- **Artifact Removal**: Includes methods for removing artifacts and noise from EEG recordings to improve feature extraction accuracy.

## Installation

To use the EEG feature extraction tools, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/EEGFeatureExtraction.git
